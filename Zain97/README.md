 # EcoPower Logistics Management System Project

Welcome to the EcoPower Logistics Management System project documentation. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, functionality, and instructions for stakeholders on how to use the reports developed as part of the project.

## Project Overview

The EcoPower Logistics Management System aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing logistics processes related to solar energy products. This includes customer management, order processing, and product inventory. The project involves creating a CRUD RESTful API that connects to a database, enabling efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **API Development**: Create a CRUD RESTful API using .NET Core 6 that interacts with a database for managing customer, order, and product data.

2. **Data Management**: Implement functionality to perform basic CRUD operations on customers, orders, and products, ensuring data integrity and security.

3. **Integration**: Connect the API to a SQL Server database hosted on Azure, allowing seamless data storage and retrieval.

4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive API documentation in the form of Swagger UI, outlining available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage instructions.

5. **Security**: Implement authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data through the API.

6. **Hosting**: Deploy the API to the cloud using Azure API Management, making it accessible to stakeholders securely over the internet.

## How to Use the Reports
